# Papa-Pojo
Papa Pojo is command line tool for Java developers. It generates code files with classes, interfaces and enums that follow common best paratictes and design patterns. Using _extremely simple_ JSON formatted templates as source files it has almost no learning curve.  
By automating some of the more mundane and error prone Java coding tasks it increases developer productivity and helps enforce standard naming conventions. It also better protects your code from schema migration errors by surfacing problems earlier at compile time.
